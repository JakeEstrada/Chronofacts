# Video Playback Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Your videos were not playing because they were encoded in **HEVC/H.265** format, which is not widely supported by web browsers. The video also had rotation metadata that could cause display issues.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Codec Issue**: The original video used HEVC (H.265) codec, which has limited browser support
2. **Rotation Metadata**: The video had `"rotate": "90"` metadata that could cause display problems
3. **File Size**: Large file size (193MB) could cause slow loading

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Video Transcoding Script (`transcode_video.py`)
- Converts HEVC/H.265 videos to H.264 format (widely supported)
- Handles rotation metadata properly
- Reduces file size while maintaining quality
- Optimizes for web streaming with `faststart` flag

### 2. Database Update Script (`update_video_urls.py`)
- Updates database records to point to transcoded videos
- Handles both original and transcoded file management
- Provides file listing and status checking

### 3. Enhanced Upload Handler
- Automatically transcodes videos during upload
- Falls back to original file if transcoding fails
- Improved error handling and logging

### 4. Enhanced Delete Handler
- Deletes both original and transcoded files when removing videos
- Maintains database consistency

## Results
- **Original Video**: 193MB, HEVC/H.265, rotation metadata
- **Transcoded Video**: 100MB, H.264, no rotation issues
- **Browser Compatibility**: Now works in all modern browsers
- **Loading Speed**: Faster due to smaller file size and web optimization

## Files Created/Modified
1. `transcode_video.py` - Video transcoding utility
2. `update_video_urls.py` - Database update utility
3. `app.py` - Enhanced upload and delete handlers
4. `test_video.html` - Video playback test page

## Testing
You can test the video playback by:
1. Opening `http://127.0.0.1:5001/test_video.html` in your browser
2. Checking the browser console for detailed video loading information
3. Comparing the original vs transcoded video playback

## Future Improvements
- Add automatic transcoding for all video formats
- Implement video thumbnail generation
- Add video compression options
- Consider implementing video streaming for very large files

## Usage
- New videos uploaded will be automatically transcoded
- Existing videos can be transcoded using: `python3 transcode_video.py`
- Database URLs can be updated using: `python3 update_video_urls.py`
